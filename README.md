## Neighborhood Viewer
A JavaScript application that lets view all of the macro-neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods of the NYC boroughs. Clicking a sub-neighborhood will highlight the borough that the neighborhood is located in.

To install the application and run it in your local environment:

- clone the repository https://github.com/gabystern/neighborhood-challenge.git
- cd into the directory
- in your terminal, run npm install and then http-server to run the application on your local server
- go to http://localhost:8080/ on your browser to view the application
